Wroctaw is a city in western Poland and the largest city in the historical region of Silesia. The city, at various times, has been part of the Kingdom
of Poland, the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Kingdom of Hungary, the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria, the Kingdom of Prussia, and Germany. This
picture shows Wroctaw Town Hall, located in the centre of the city's Market Square. One of the chief landmarks of the city, the Gothic building was
developed over a period of about 250 years, from the end of the 13th century to the middle of the 16th century. During the 1930s, the official role of
the town hall was reduced, and the building was converted into a museum. It suffered minor damage during World War II, after which the entire
region was transferred to the Polish People's Republic.
